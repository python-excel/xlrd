Many thanks to to John Machin for originally writing :mod:`xlrd` and tirelessly

*   OpenOffice.org has truly excellent documentation of the Microsoft Excel file formats and Compound Document file format, authored by Daniel Rentz. See http://sc.openoffice.org
*   U+5F20 U+654F: over a decade of inspiration, support, and interesting decoding opportunities.
*   Ksenia Marasanova: sample Macintosh and non-Latin1 files, alpha testing
*   Backporting to Python 2.1 was partially funded by Journyx - provider of timesheet and project accounting solutions (http://journyx.com/).

Development of this package would not have been possible without the document
OpenOffice.org's Documentation of the Microsoft Excel File Format"
("OOo docs" for short).
The latest version is available from OpenOffice.org in
`PDF format`__ and `ODT format`__.
Small portions of the OOo docs are reproduced in this
document. A study of the OOo docs is recommended for those who wish a
deeper understanding of the Excel file layout than the xlrd docs can provide.
